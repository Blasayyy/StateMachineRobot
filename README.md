# StateMachine Robot Project

## Description

This python project was done within the context of our "Objets connect√©s" (connected objects) class. The project was separated into two parts. First, we had to create a generic library implementing a state machine. This library provides classes for a FiniteStateMachine, which handles all the states and transitions a developper could add to it as well as the main loop or tick of the state. It also includes every class needed to make it work, including different states used for purposes such as monitoring conditions and/or performing actions. Each state inheriting from ActionState can be passed a callable object for its entering, in-state, and exiting actions which will be executed by the FiniteStateMachine. The library also includes classes for different types of transitions used to change from state to state, as well as a generic Blinker class used to handle any sort of blink mechanism required. This class inherits from FiniteStateMachine. In the second part of the project, we were handed GoPiGo3 robots, and had to implement the library we had created to perform tasks on the robot. This included a robot initialisation/startup series of states, a home state that listens for remote control input to enter different tasks, two tasks that the robot can perform, a robot class to handle its components, and a state machine class that handles the entire program.
